# Tic-Tac-Toe MIPS Project Structure

## Team Responsibilities

### 1. Board Management & Initialization (Person 1)
- Data segment setup (board structure, lines, size)
- Board initialization
- Board drawing functionality (`draw_board`)
- Basic testing of board display

### 2. Input & Move Validation (Person 2)
- Input handling for both players
- Move validation logic (`InvalidMove`)
- Coordinate system implementation
- Testing various input scenarios

### 3. Game Logic - Player Moves (Person 3)
- `play_x` implementation
- `play_y` implementation
- Move execution logic
- Testing move execution

### 4. Win Condition Checking (Person 4)
All win condition checks:
- Row checks (`winRow0`, `winRow1`, `winRow2`)
- Column checks (`winCol0`, `winCol1`, `winCol2`)
- Diagonal checks (`winDiag0`, `winDiag1`)
- Testing win conditions

### 5. Main Game Flow & UI (Person 5)
- Main game loop
- User interface messages/prompts
- Game state management
- Instructions display
- Final integration and testing

## Project Phases

### Initial Setup (Everyone)
1. Set up MIPS development environment
2. Review requirements and game rules together
3. Agree on naming conventions and documentation standards

### First Steps by Role
- **Person 1**: Implement basic board structure and display
- **Person 2**: Begin with basic input handling
- **Person 3**: Create structure for move execution
- **Person 4**: Set up framework for win condition checking
- **Person 5**: Set up basic game loop and UI messages

### Development Process
1. Individual component development
2. Regular team meetings for compatibility checks
3. Incremental integration
4. Component testing
5. Final integration

### Integration Order
1. Board display + Input handling
2. Move execution + Board updates
3. Win condition checking
4. Game flow and UI
5. Final polish and bug fixes
